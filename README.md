# Module 12 Challenge:   Bellybutton

## Overview of Project
The objective of this project was use Plotly to chart Bellybutton data as a BarChart, BubbleChart and Gauge using Javascript, HTML, CSS, Plotly,
and reading data from a local JSON file.   Because of the CORS policy, which protects local devices from harm, students used http.server 
to start a local host to allow the script to read a local JSON file.

Other techniques used in this project included slicing and sorting data read from a JSON file.

Last part of the challenge asked students to change elements to enhance the web page by making it mobile, modifying the css style sheet,
and also modifying HTML.

## Results
Some challenges with this project were reading the JSON file and parsing key value pairs to loop through metadata and samples stored
in the samples.json file.
